# Tentative (Not Certain How This Will Work) White Paper

Launchpad is a program that helps content creators on Scratch gain momentum and attract attention to their projects and before their release.

## Project Pages

Project pages are where users put the information about their upcoming project. This would not be cloud based, and would have to be added manually. (We could use cloud, but only for stuff like creators updating their estimated release date.)

Users would need to show at least a semi-functioning concept of their project before approval.

Components of the project page:

- Title

- Image slideshow

- Expected Release date
- Short description
- Progress Notifications (ability to subscribe to notifications)


## Accounts

There will be two types of accounts. Project accounts, and user accounts. (Will work on user pages soon.) Project accounts can only have one project.
User accounts get to subscribe to project accounts to receive notifications for progress on the project.
